    <center><h2>RULES OF VALUES GAME</h2></center>
    <h3>In general</h3>
        ◦ You will have 2 hours and 30 minutes to play the game.<br>
        ◦ The group appoints a team leader who makes sure the rules are followed, keeps track of time and writes down the points and important comments from the discussions in the relevant forms. The team leader also participates in the game.<br>
        ◦ You will have one playing piece as a group, which will move clockwise around the game wheel. Each time next person throws the dice. Then participants take turns.
    <h3>Dilemmas</h3>
        ◦ The team leader reads the situation out loud. Each player makes their decision individually by choosing one of the decision cards marked 1–6 and placing it on the table, face down. Do not talk or discuss while doing this.<br>
        ◦ When everyone has made their choice, flip the cards so everyone can see them. The team leader notes down the choices in the virtual scoring sheet.<br>
        ◦ A group discussion will then follow with the objective of agreeing on a shared decision for the entire group (max 10 min).<br>
        ◦ N.B. A majority decision is not enough! The entire group must be unanimous. Those who decide to change their first choice to support another alternative must explain why.<br>
        ◦ When the group has agreed on a common answer, press the “next page” on the screen to see the points awarded for your chosen option. The team leader records the score in the scoring sheet?<br>
        ◦ If the team does not reach the unanimous decision, they get - 400 points.<br>
        ◦ It is also very important to know if we are acting like this today. Choose individually the score from 1 to 5 indicating how often you behave in the best scoring option manner.<br>
        ◦ The leader writes down the comments to the situation discussed in the comments form.<br>
    <h3>Knowledge about us</h3>
        ◦ During this part of the game, participants answer questions about US by choosing one of 3 possible answers.<br>
        ◦ When the wheel stops on the "Knowledge about us" field, the team leader reads the question out loud.<br>
        ◦ If the player answers the question correctly, the answer is worth + 200 points, whilst the incorrect answer is worth 0 points.<br>
        ◦ The scoring will be seen in your scoring field immediately?
    <h3>Risks and opportunities</h3>
        ◦ You either win or lose points. It is equivalent to “Chance” in Monopoly.<br>
        ◦ The team leader writes down the points in the last column of the scoring sheet?
